# Python-api-challenge
## Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. In this challenge, we perform Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
## Repo Overview
A new repository named 'python-api-challenge' is created and cloned to the local computer. Inside the local Git repository, a new directory named 'WeatherPy' is created. The folder contains the separate Jupyter Notebook for the given task.
Data Analysis and summary is included within the Jupyter Notebook.
